= FiveRuns Dash recipe for Ruby on Rails

Provides a Ruby API to push metrics from a Rails app to the FiveRuns Dash service, http://dash.fiveruns.com, currently in beta.

You'll need a Dash account before using this library.

== Installation

This library is released as a gem from the official repository at http://github.com/fiveruns/dash-rails

  sudo gem install fiveruns-dash-rails --source http://gems.github.com

== Usage

See the Dash Ruby support pages http://support.fiveruns.com/faqs/dash/ruby for information on how to use this library. 

== Authors

The FiveRuns Development Team & Dash community

== Dependencies

* The fiveruns-dash-activerecord gem (http://github.com/fiveruns/dash-activerecord)
* The fiveruns-dash-ruby gem (http://github.com/fiveruns/dash-ruby)
* The json gem (as a dependency for fiveruns-dash-ruby)

== Verifying your setup

Once you've configured your app for Dash, you can run the following command to make sure everything is in order:

  script/runner 'Fiveruns::Dash::Rails.verify'

This will make sure dash-rails is properly loaded, there are no known compatibility problems and that you've properly set your token and your app can communicate with the Dash servers.

== Rails versions

Dash has been tested with Rails 2.2 and 2.1.  It may (or may not) work with Rails 2.0 applications.

We have verified an incompatibility that occurs when the +json+ gem is unpacked. The recommended workaround is to use a localized +GEM_HOME+ or a system gem.

== Platforms

This library has only been tested on OSX and Linux.  See the notes for fiveruns-dash-ruby for more information: http://github.com/fiveruns/dash-ruby
