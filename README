Thanks for trying out FiveRuns Dash!  You will need to configure Dash with your
application token before it can contact the Dash server.  Just add the following
code to RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/dash.rb:

Fiveruns::Dash::Rails.configure :production => 'YOUR-APP-TOKEN-HERE'

That's it!  Read more about Dash and its more advanced features here:

Enjoy!
